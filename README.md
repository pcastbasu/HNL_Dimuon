# HNL_Dimuon
In this repository, I have saved my work on the search for HNL-induced dimuon events in the IceCube observatory. Naming of directories and files is quite self-explanatory. The main simulation script is "simulation.py", the simulation files are stored in the "simulations" directory, and different plot examples are in the Jupyter Notebooks within the repository. Note that running this code requires previous installation of [SIREN](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/SIREN/tree/dev/HNL_DIS) in the 'dev/HNL_DIS' branch.
